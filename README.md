Write a Python program that asks the user to input the current temperature in Celsius. Based on
the input, your program should display an appropriate message:
1. If the temperature is greater than or equal to 30, print:
"It's a hot day. Stay hydrated!"
2. If the temperature is between 20 and 29 (inclusive), print:
"It's a warm day. Enjoy the weather!"
3. If the temperature is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), print:
"It's a cool day. Wear a jacket!"
4. If the temperature is below 10, print:
"It's a cold day. Stay warm!"
